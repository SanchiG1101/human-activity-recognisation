This project involves analyzing data collected from the accelerometer and gyroscope of a Samsung Galaxy S smartphone to recognize human activities. The dataset contains measurements related to various physical activities like walking, sitting, standing, etc.

The project aims to:
1. Merge training and test data sets.
2. Extract measurements related to mean and standard deviation.
3. Label activities with descriptive names.
4. Clean the dataset by renaming columns with more descriptive names.
5. Create a tidy dataset with average values of each variable for each activity and subject.
